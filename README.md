# Determing-Shape-And-Dimension-of-Objects-In-Given-Image
Measuring objects within an image or frame can be an important capability for many applications where computer vision is required instead of making physical measurements. 
This application note will cover a basic step-by-step algorithm for isolating a desired object and measuring its diameter/dimension. 
It will also try to determine the 2D shape it has using OpenCV shape detection library. 
This application can be used in determining the dimension and shape of space objects using the 2D image we are available with
